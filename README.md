Instead of clothes, skincare, or health products, the 'product' is games. (Because this is just a demo, though I *could* make a non-demo one) ðŸ˜Ž

This project is a product search app, that has a cart as well. You can't sign in or create an account, because you can only have a cart, that would be stored in the application.

And when you click on the product card, it would lead you to Steam, Itch, or their website.
